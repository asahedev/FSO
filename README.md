# Full Stack Open course
<p>
Here you find my exercises and notes for this course where I learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript. This course introduces you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.
